# Paradigm Threat CMS

The Paradigm Threat CMS is written in ReactJS (NodeJS) making use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax. 
All site content is managed through a shared git-repository which provides deployment, version control, 
and user access without needing a database service. This makes the CMS invulnerable to 
[DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) and hacking attempts. 
The CMS has been used to gather contributing documents for our team investigations.
